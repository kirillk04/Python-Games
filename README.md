# Python-Games
Within the code, users are offered a choice of 3 games. These games are hangman, a number guessing game or a test for typing speed.

Hangman is played simply with a word being chosen at random from a list and then the user is given chances to guess letters for the word. If guessed correctly, the letter will appear in the correct place to give users hints. 

The number guessing game allows users to pick a number between 0 and 100. The code will then ask users basic questions to guess what number the user is thinking of. They are all basic questions and the code will attempt to guess the number at the end.

The typing speed game is a words per minute exercise in which users are given a text that they must type in while the code will keep track of time and at the end inform users of their total time and their time per minute.
